AICTE Internship Project - Climate Risk and Disaster Management
This repository contains my AICTE Internship project on Climate Risk and Disaster Management using the Forest Fire Dataset (derived from NASA’s EONET API via Kaggle). The project focuses on analyzing natural disasters such as wildfires, forestfire and there impact.

📌 Week 1 Project
In Week 1, the goal was to reach the Data Understanding stage:

Imported necessary Python libraries (pandas, numpy)
Loaded the dataset (Data.csv)
Explored dataset using:
.info() → structure of data
.describe() → summary statistics
.isnull().sum() → missing values check
Previewed disaster categories and their counts
This forms the foundation for deeper analysis and visualization in upcoming weeks.
